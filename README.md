# Favorite-cmd-commands
=================================

**1- ( git init )**

When I be in a folder and I want to creat a repository in it.


**2- ( git add )**

I use it to add files to a new commit


**3- ( git commit )**

*git commit -m "< Message >"* 
`I use it to commit the added files.`


**Note:** 
We can use the first command to creat the repository for the first time in the folder.

But we can use *git add* and *git commit* every time we make changing in ower files.
